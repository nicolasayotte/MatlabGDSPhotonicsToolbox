2014-March-26, Ulf Griesmann
- version 114a
- removed the General Polygon Clipper library. Boolean operations are
  now based on the Clipper library by Angus Johnson only.

2014-March-16, Ulf Griesmann
- version 113a
- new version 6.1.x of clipper library for Boolean polygon 
  operations.

2014-January-15, Ulf Griesmann
- versin 112a
- eliminate global variable in '@gds_library/treecopy.m' and
  '@gds_library/subtree.m' and use nested functions instead.
  Requires Octave 3.8. Should be a bit faster.

2013-December-18, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111s
- fixed a long standing bug in '@gds_structure/add_ref.m'. When the 
  second argument is a cell array of structures, references to the
  names of the top level structure(s) in the array are created. This 
  change finally makes the function what it should have been all along.
- added an option to 'topstruct.m' to make it always return a cell array. 

2013-December-16, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111r
- fixed a bug in 'Structures/gdsii_multref.m'.

2013-November-20, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111p
- new function 'gdsii_multref.m' in 'Structures'
  directory which simplifies the creation of layouts with
  many replicated structures, but is not restricted to
  a grid.

2013-November-15, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111o
- fixed an error message in 'gds_write_element.c'
- don't use C++ style comments because less recent versions
  of gcc don't like them.

2013-October-09, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111n
- begin a FAQ.

2013-October-02, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111m
- fixed a bug in @gds_element/display.m. strans records were
  not displayed correctly when the optional MAG or ANGLE records
  were not present.

2013-September-22, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111k
- streamlined method @gds_structure/add_ref.m

2013-September-18, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111i
- no longer return the record length in 'gds_record_info.c' when it is
  not needed; bit faster, because the variable 'rlen' no longer needs 
  to be created.
- method 'numel' for the 'gds_library' class returns the number of
  elements in a library.

2013-September-11, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111h
- better error messages in gds_element constructor.

2013-September-3, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111e,f,g
- fixed: a MATLAB-only bug in the gds_element class constructor (actually
  a MATLAB vs. Octave incompatibility: Octave consistently treats an empty matrix like 
  an empty string; MATLAB does not. Empty matrices are accepted e.g. in strcmp, but
  not in switch statements.)
- fixed a quirk in mxlist.c which makes it easier to call get_current_entry 
- MSC compiler did not compile the new byte swapping functions correctly (!).
- use the generic Excess64 <--> IEEE 754 float conversion functions for MSC.

2013-September-2, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111b,c,d
- fixed a bug in @gds_library/subsref.m relating to field name
  indexing of structures in a library
- added a method @gds_library/snames.m which returns the names
  of structures in a library and a struct enabling fast structure
  lookup using structure names (the problem, though, is that not all valid
  GDS II variable names are valid MATLAB/Octave variable names).
- fixed a bug introduced in version 107a. The idiom S(:) for
  copying all elements of a structure and L(:) for copying all structures 
  of a library now works.
- better help text for 'write_gds_library' function.

2013-September-1, Ulf Griesmann
- version 111a
- Improved functions for byte swapping. The inline functions compile
  to 'bswap' instructions with GCC. 
- use faster floating point number conversion functions 
  excess-64 <--> IEEE754. Results in significant speedup with elements
  that have float-value properties (e.g. sref).

2013-August-23, Ulf Griesmann
- version 110a
- rewrote get_element_data.c and set_element_data.c by replacing the jump
  tables with arrays of function pointers within the hash functions to eliminate
  the double property lookup in the previous versions. Clean, and also faster.
- several small fixes, especially in error messages here and there.
- enable array indexing to access the xy property of elements 
  (see @gds_element/subsref.m).

2013-August-22, Ulf Griesmann
- version 109e
- remove .o files after compiling mex files on Octave / Windows

2013-August-21, Ulf Griesmann
- version 109d
- improvements in read_gds_library.m
- corrected usage message in 'cgdsconv' script

2013-August-19, Ulf Griesmann
- version 109b,c
- fixed bugs in writing compound sref elements.
- several small bug fixes.
- 'cgdsconv' Octave script to convert files in compound GDS (.cgds)
  format into standard GDS II (.gds) files. 

2013-August-18, Ulf Griesmann
- version 109a
- libraries can be stored in a new compound GDS format with file
  extension .cgds. In the new format, boundary, path, and sref elements
  can have multiple XY records. When reading the library, the multiple
  XY records are read into compound elements. .cgds files are more compact
  and much easier to read into Octave/MATLAB in some cases, e.g. in layouts
  with very large numbers of sref elements.

2013-August-14, Ulf Griesmann
- version 108b
- no longer print top level structures after reading a library even in
  verbose mode. For a library with many sref elements, it can take
  "forever".

2013-August-14, Ulf Griesmann
- version 108a
- new gds_ftell mex function
- better progress reporting with % of file read.
- fixed a bug in @gds_element/get.m

2013-August-13, Ulf Griesmann
- version 107b-107c
- replace snprintf --> sprintf because Microsoft's C libraries don't 
  have snprintf.
- fix makemex.m and omakemex.m scripts for Windows.

2013-August-12, Ulf Griesmann
- version 107a
- omakemex.m script to make mex files on Octave/Windows
- fixed a bug in @gds_element/add_poly.m
- fixed bug in gdsii_bitmap.m; sref elements don't have layer
  properties.
- big change: store most element properties in a C structure that is
  accessible through a set of mex functions to make the toolbox much
  more memory efficient, especially for layouts with large numbers of
  sref elements (several 100 Million). Should be faster too.
- hash tables are used to access element properties.
- make the idiom X(:) work for gds_structure and gds_library objects 
- fix bug in 'gdsii_cdfeature.m': sref elements don't have a layer property.

2013-July-20, Ulf Griesmann
- version 106e
- fixed a bug in gds_write_element.c. plex numbers of box elements
  were not written correctly.

2013-July-14, Ulf Griesmann
- version 106d
- update the clipper library for polygon algebra to 
  version 5.1.6

2013-July-10, Ulf Griesmann
- version 106c
- small fixes to cleanup and makemex-octave scripts.

2013-June-27, Ulf Griesmann
- version 106b
- better summary printout in 'gds_peek'.

2013-June-27, Ulf Griesmann
- version 106a
- new function 'gds_cat.m' to merge layout files. The new
  function is able to merge very large layout files (10GB or more)
  by copying the files structure by structure without holding entire
  libraries in memory. It's slow, but it gets there.
- function 'gds_peek.m' which scans a GDS II file and prints out
  structure names within it and element statistics. Can inspect
  very large files because only structures are read into memory, not 
  the entire library.
- little fixes here and there.

2013-April-22, Ulf Griesmann
- version 105e
- fixed the help text for 'Structures/gdsii_replicate.m'

2013-March-22, Ulf Griesmann
- version 105d
- fixed a bug in gds_write_element.c that resulted in a 
  segmentation fault when the number of vertices in a 
  boundary element was > 4096.

2013-February-25, Ulf Griesmann
- version 105c
- modified 'datamatrixmex.c' to make it compile on older
  versions of GCC (contributed by Patrick Gill).
- modified 'gdsio.c' to work with older versions of GCC.
- renamed 'file_exist.m' --> 'gds_file_exists.m' to make
  a function name collision less likely.

2013-February-9, Ulf Griesmann
- version 105b
- removed gdsii_layer global variable from functions
  in the Elements directory.

2013-February-4, Ulf Griesmann
- version 105a
- D'OH ... need to open files with 'b' on Windows. Now it
  works with MATLAB too.
- improved / renamed some of the Octave scripts.

2013-February-1, Ulf Griesmann
- version 104a
- at long last found the bugs in reading and writing of
  the bitarray records STRANS and PRESENTATION. They are 
  not documented correctly (or documented confusingly) in 
  the documentation from Klaas Holwerda.

2013-January-31, Ulf Griesmann
- version 103a
- fixed reading of element properties.
- STRANS bitfield is mandatory and will always
  be written even if no bits are set.
- fixed path extensions for path type 4.
- fixed text alignment
- several fixes in @gds_element/display.m (especially
  for text elements).
Problem: does not run on MATLAB - reason unknown.

2013-January-30, Ulf Griesmann
- version 102[cde]
- more bug fixes in mex functions.

2013-January-27, Ulf Griesmann
- version 102b
- lots of small bug fixes, and a big
  bug in gdsio.c

2013-January-22, Ulf Griesmann
- version 102a
- MSVS C compiler does not understand 'inline'; only
  inline functions with GNU C.
- fixed several bugs in 'gds_write_element.c'
- fixed bugs in 'gds_initialize.m'.
- gave up on Makefile for Octave and use 'makemex-octave'
  script again; it's easier and less error prone.
- removed the 'gdsii_deflayer.m' function. The notion
  of a 'default layer' is now gone. 

2013-January-21, Ulf Griesmann
- version 101a
- on Linux the mex files can now be build with 'make'.
- small bug fixes.

2013-January-19, Ulf Griesmann
- version 100a
- low level I/O is now done with a set of mex functions
  which bypasses the MATLAB/Octave fwrite/fread functions.
  Approximately 4x - 5x faster than the original pure 
  Octave/Matlab I/O functions.
- fixed calculation and display of elapsed time during
  reading and writing of library files. 
- new version of Clipper library (5.0.3).  
- correctly handle ELFLAGS records.

=============

2013-February-2, Ulf Griesmann
- version 99a
- Finally set the correct bits in the bitarray
  records STRANS and PRESENTATION (see version 104a).

2013-January-30, Ulf Griesmann
- version 98a
- no longer write out angles and magnifications
  in STRANS records that have default values. Makes
  writing files with many sref elements faster.

2013-January-27, Ulf Griesmann
- version 97c
- re-instate the 'poly_convert' name for
  structure and library polygon conversion methods. 

2013-January-23, Ulf Griesmann
- version 97b
- re-instate reading of fonts (but we don't do 
  anything with them).

2013-January-22, Ulf Griesmann
- version 97a
- no longer prints out top level structures by default
  when writing a file, because it can be very time 
  consuming to calculate the top level structures when
  the library contains a large number of reference elements.

2012-December-28, Ulf Griesmann
- version 96a
- skip unknown records in the library header instead
  of stopping.
- new 'srename' method for gds_library objects to 
  rename a structure and all references to the structure
  in a library.
- boundary and path elements always store polygons in a cell
  array even if they have only one polygon. This much simplifies
  several methods in the gds_element class.

2012-December-21, Ulf Griesmann
- version 95e
- small fix in gdsii_aref.m - added missing ';'
- print out read and write times in HH:MM:SS.FFF format.

2012-December-15, Ulf Griesmann
- version 95c
- polygon algebra functions check for empty polygons.

2012-December-14, Ulf Griesmann
- version 95b
- layerinfo.m can't be a method, moved it to 'funcs'.
- small cleanup in 'gdsii_path.m"

2012-December-9, Ulf Griesmann
- version 95a
- fixed a long standing bug: elements can have more
  than one property (attribute/value pair).

2012-December-8, Ulf Griesmann
- version 94e
- added a function 'topstruct.m' that returns the
  top level structure(s) of a cell array of gds_structure
  objects.

2012-December-7, Ulf Griesmann
- version 94d
- fixed a bug in 'parse_element_data.m'
- improved '@gds_structure/add_ref.m': default reference
  position is [0,0]; a cell array of structure elements
  can now be passed as the 2nd argument, which creates
  reference elements for all of them.
- remove all calls to 'reshape' from the basic io functions.

2012-December-6, Ulf Griesmann
- version 94c
- fixed find_ref.m to make sure it does not consume
  a large amount of memory with layouts that have
  very many reference elements.

2012-December-1, Ulf Griesmann
- version 94b
- reinstated subtree, which now returns indices of structures
  in a library object that make up a subtree. All tools needed
  to work with structure graphs are now provided.
- renamed gds_io directory to gdsio. Looks better.

2012-November-30, Ulf Griesmann
- version 94a
- renamed subtree.m --> treecopy.m
- function @gds_library/private/adjmatrix.m which computes
  the structure graph now uses a sparse matrix. Slightly slower
  but the structure graph for layouts with thousands of structures
  can now be calculated.

2012-November-29, Ulf Griesmann
- version 93c
- library writing was broken on MATLAB because 'zeros'
  works with 'logical' only in Octave.
  
2012-November-25, Ulf Griesmann
- version 93b
- oops. Broke 'read_gds_library.m'

2012-November-25, Ulf Griesmann
- version 93a
- move all low-level I/O functions into a directory 'Basic/gds_io'
  in preparation of rewriting much of the low-level IO as mex 
  functions to make IO fast.
- cleaned up and corrected writing and reading of REFLIBS and 
  ATTRTABLE records - even though they are not likely to be used
  much, if ever ...

2012-November-20, Ulf Griesmann
- version 92a
- new methods 'poly_iscw' and 'poly_cw' for the gds_element class
  to query and modify polygon orientation in boundary elements
- 'read_gds_library' only prints the top level structure in 
  verbose mode, because calculating the top level structure is
  quite slow in layouts with many sref elements.
- 'Scripts' directory with useful Octave script(s) that can be run
  directly from a shell prompt in Linux / Unix environments
  (real or emulated).
- improve 'poly_convert' for structures and rename to 'polygonize'. 
  Now ignores text elements.
- use 'logical' data type for the adjacency matrix in 'adjmatrix.m'. 
  Not faster but uses a lot less memory, which matters for layouts
  with thousands of structures.
- create layout file with 'W' in 'gdsii_initialize.m' in MATLAB, which
  suppresses buffer flushing after each call to fwrite.
- in poly_boolmex.c and poly_boolmex.cpp return the hole flags as a 
  logical array instead of double.

2012-November-16, Ulf Griesmann
- version 91a
- lower the default verbosity in 'read_gds_library', because
  printing the structure names is impractical for layouts with
  thousands of structures.
- 'layerstat' function to display information about distribution of
  elements over layers.
- fixed a bug in 'gdsii_read_boundary.m'.

2012-November-13, Ulf Griesmann
- version 90b
- try to deallocate memory in poly_boolmex.cpp
- latest version 4.9.6 of Clipper library.

2012-November-12, Ulf Griesmann
- version 90a
- better directory structure for the toolbox.
- better scripts for making the mex files.
- the old procedural way of creating GDS II layout
  files is no longer supported. All higher level
  functions now only return objects.
- 'noel' and 'gf' arguments removed from 'gdsii_ptext'.
- 'gf' argument removed from 'gdsii_arc'.
- removed 'gf' argument from 'gdsii_bitmap'.
- removed 'gf' argument from 'gdsii_datamatrix' and
  added 'sname' argument for name of top level structure.
- removed 'gf' argument from 'gdsii_grating'.
- removed 'gf' argument from 'gdsii_replicate'; fixed a bug.
- removed 'gf' argument from 'gdsii_sierpinski'.
- removed 'gf' argument from 'gdsii_checky'.
- removed 'gf' argument from 'gdsii_cdfeature'.
- removed 'gf' argument from 'gdsii_pattern'.
- '@gds_structure/add_ref.m' did not correctly generate aref
  elements; fixed.

2012-November-10, Ulf Griesmann
- version 88a
- renamed polyboolmex.* --> poly_boolmex.* 
- polygon clipping can now be done with the Clipper
  library by Angus Johnson (this is the preferred way).
- small bug fixes.

2012-November-05, Ulf Griesmann
- version 87b
- Microsoft C is not C99 conformant, does not have 'round'.
  Change to 'floor + 0.5' so that polyboolmex.c compiles.

2012-November-04, Ulf Griesmann
- version 87
- fixed bugs in 'gdsii_arc.m'. Full circles are now rendered correctly.
- warning when path elements have > 4095 vertices.
- display number of paths in a compound path element.
- make 'write_gds_library' more talkative by default.
- fixed a quirk in 'gdsii_read_strans.m'.
- overload the '+' operator for the gds_element class. This can be used 
  to combine boundary, path, and sref elements on the same layer into 
  compound elements.
- fixed a bug in 'gdsii_units'.
- rewrote 'polyboolmex.c' for the GPC library to take full advantage of the 
  GPC library and to make it compatible with the mex function for the Clipper 
  library. The new mex function should be faster too when clipping many polygons.

2012-August-26, Ulf Griesmann
- version 86
- 'poly_bool' method for the gds_element class for boolean set algebra 
  on GDS boundary elements. Currently only the GPC library is used, 
  eventually it will also be possible to use the Clipper library, 
  which has a less restrictive license.
- full support for paths having more than one path segment
  (= compound paths, a GDS II toolbox extension)

2012-August-22, Ulf Griesmann
- version 85
- very long paths with up to 8191 vertices are now possible.
- compound path elements containing more than one polygon are
  now supported.

2012-July-31, Ulf Griesmann
- version 84
- changed gdsii_excess64dec.c so that it can be compiled
  with the C compiler (LCC) that comes with MATLAB.
- small tweaks here and there

2012-January-29, Ulf Griesmann
- version 83
- use structure array instead of structure cell array in 'gdsii_ptext.m' for
  the glyph data.
- replace for loops with 'cellfun' in write_library.m and write_structure.m
- minor cleanup in read_gds_library.m
- simplified 'poly_rotz' function in gdsii_ptext.m
- made @gds_structure/subsasgn.m simpler and a bit faster.
- made @gds_structure/add_element.m simpler and a bit faster.
- avoid calls to subsasgn.m in gdsii_read_struct.m to make function faster.
  Speedup > 10x for some files with many elements.
- fixed a bug in gdsii_elflags.m
- fixed a bug in gdsii_plex.m
- eliminate 'bitget' and 'bitset' and replace them with 'bitor' and 'bitand'
  equivalents. Under Octave this results in a x2 speedup for library files with
  many STRANS records because 'bitset' and 'bitget' are very slow.

2012-January-14, Ulf Griesmann
- version 82
- small changes, several fixes in the help texts.

2012-January-08, Ulf Griesmann
- version 81
- path extensions are initialized to 0 for type 4 paths.
- all ASCII characters from 32 to 126 are now supported
  in 'gdsii_ptext.m' and several characters were tweaked 
  to look better.

2012-January-04, Ulf Griesmann
- version 80
- bug fix: bit array of strans records was written wrong.
- bug fix: rows and colums of aref elements were read in the wrong order.
- there are still some more bugs ...

2012-January-02, Ulf Griesmann
- version 79
- modified gdsii_initialize.m to store the correct library name in the 
  GDS II files, not merely the file name.

2011-December-27, Ulf Griesmann
- version 78
- fixed bug in gdsii_path.m :  path extensions were written at 
  the wrong place in the record.
- tweak to @gds_element/display.m :  not all elements have a layer
  property.
- small change to CD feature; space between 0.9 um and 0.8 um feature
  is larger.
- fixed a couple of small bugs in gdsii_path.m: 'width' and 'ptype' are
  optional.

2011-December-20, Ulf Griesmann
- version 77
- fixed a bug in @gds_library/get.m
- fixed a bug in @gds_library/add_struct.m
- fixed bug in gdsii_cdfeature.m. Now works
  for all user units, not only 1 um.

2011-December-18, Ulf Griesmann
- version 76
- fixed a bug in the get methods for the gds_structure and
  gds_library classes.
- deriving the file name from the library name works better now.
- updated manual/tutorial.

2011-December-16, Ulf Griesmann
- version 75
- fixed more bugs in file reading. gdsii_read_box actually
  created a node element - and vice versa. Not that either of
  these seems very useful ...
- speeded up file reading by about 25% by bypassing error checking
  when reading a file. It's still too slow when many elements 
  must be read - but that's MATLAB.

2011-December-15, Ulf Griesmann
- version 74
- improved the poly_path method; it is now twice as fast 
  as before.
- tweaked the display of library and structure dates
- fixed bug in 'gdsii_read_text.m'. tverj and thorj 
  were not initialized.
- added support for path type 4 (finally figured out how).
- check if all structure names are unique before writing
  a library file.
- add_poly method to add more polygons to a boundary element.

2011-December-14, Ulf Griesmann
- version 73
- speed up computation of the adjacency matrix of the
  structure tree a lot. It's now fast enough even when
  a library contains a substantial number of structures.

2011-December-13, Ulf Griesmann
-version 72
- made 'find' method for 'gds_structure' elements simpler
  again. Makes treeview method faster.
- gdsii_ptext.m can also return the raw polygons instead of a 
  boundary element which is sometimes useful.
- fixed a bug in 'gdsii_path.m': path type was not initialized
  to 0.
- fixed a bug in the 'add_element' method for structures.
- fixed a bug in @gds_structure/set.m: Matlab doesn't like !=
- fixed a bug in 'read_gds_library.m': use & instead of &&
- made the 'adjmatrix.m' function simpler and a lot faster. This
  uses a new 'findref' method that is used to identify reference
  elements in structures.
- made subsref.m method for elements simpler and faster. 
  It can no longer be used to query the element type, but this
  can still be done with the 'is_etype' and 'get' methods.
- added methods poly_box, poly_text, and poly_path to the gds_element
  class for converting these elements to boundary elements. 
- added the poly_convert method the gds_structure class for convenient 
  conversion of box, path, and text elements to equivalent boundary
  elements.   

2011-December-06, Ulf Griesmann
- version 71
- use the DEPLOF lithography font (David Elata, MEMS Lab, Technion, Haifa,
  Israel) which has upper and lower case letters, numerals, and punctuation
  characters.
- methods add_struct and add_ref for gds_structure objects and
  add_struct for gds_library objects to make it easier to construct
  structure hierarchies.

2011-December-3, Ulf Griesmann
- version 70
- no longer ignore the structure date fields
- unrecognized element properties are now ignored and
  file reading continues with a warning.
- set method for the gds_structure class
- iterators 'libraryfun.m' and 'structfun.m' for the gds_library
  and gds_structure classes.
- treeview method for gds_library objects to display the structure
  hierarchy
- subtree method to for copying a structure from a library together
  with all referenced structures.
- topstruct method for gds_library objects to display the name(s)
  of the top level structure(s)
- removed the 'horzcat' method for gds_structure objects, because it
  does not seem possible to implement it in a clean way.

2011-November-29, Ulf Griesmann
- version 69
- faster reading of libraries (as fast as possible in pure Matlab/Octave)
- fixed several bugs in reading functions which caused element properties
  to be set wrong when reading a library.

2011-November-28, Ulf Griesmann
- version 67, 68
- fixed two bugs (use of '!=' for not equal) that work on 
  Octave but not in MATLAB.

2011-November-26, Ulf Griesmann
- version 66
- fixed a bug in gdsii_cdfeature.m, it still used the removed
  'add' method.

2011-November-26, Ulf Griesmann
- version 65
- fixed an error in the 'makemex.m' script.
- corrected small error in 'gdsii_arc.m'
- fixed bug in write_gds_library (missing ;)

2011-November-26, Ulf Griesmann
- version 64
- more bug fixes, writing now seems to work as before
- debugged the reading, works now. Still too slow ...
- can specify file name for gds_library write method.
- many example scripts

2011-November-20, Ulf Griesmann
- version 62
- can overwrite existing files when the file name begins with '!'.
- can read GDS II files.
- find method for flexible filtering of elements in structures.
- very many bug fixes

2011-July-22, Ulf Griesmann
- version 61
- fix 'makemex.m' script.

2011-July-16, Ulf Griesmann
- version 60
- existing files are no longer overwritten. Instead, a backup
  of existing library files is made.
- The REFLIBS record in the library file header is supported. External 
  structures can now be used.
- The order of arguments for several functions was changed to make
  the argument sequence uniform for all functions that write element data
  to a library file.
- An object oriented framework (gds_structure, gds_element) was added
  to the toolbox to enable in-memory representation of a GDS II 
  structure hierarchy. This is needed to make reading GDS II library files 
  possible.
- A document ("GDS II for the Rest of Us") explains the structure of GDS II
  library file, and how to create and edit these files using the GDS
  II toolbox.
- Several example scripts.

  can now be specified as an option, as can the height of the label.

2011-Jun-09, Ulf Griesmann
- version 50
- made the resolution feature more sophisticated with a "negative" line
  between two larger exposed areas.

2011-Apr-23, Ulf Griesmann
- version 48
- fixed a bug in 'gdsii_checky'
- 'gdsii_grating' can generate gratings with different duty cycles.
- 'gdsii_bitmap' now writes the bitmap in correct orientation.

2011-Mar-26, Ulf Griesmann
- version 46
- fixed the bugs in gdsii_bitmap

2011-Mar-23, Ulf Griesmann
- version 45
- bitmap can use a pixel defined by an external structure.

2011-Mar-04, Ulf Griesmann
- version 42
- 'gdsii_arc' can be used to create complete circles

2011-Feb-28, Ulf Griesmann
- version 41
- added function 'gdsii_bitmap', which converts a bitmap into
  a GDS II structure.
- 'gdsii_datamatrix' uses 'gdsii_bitmap'.

2011-Feb-26, Ulf Griesmann
- version 40
- added function 'gdsii_arc'.
- cleaned up help texts. References to 'gdsii_start' replaced with
  'gdsii_initialize'.

2011-Feb-20, Ulf Griesmann
- streamline 'gdsii_datamatrix'.
- 'gdsii_sref' now can place several reference records at once.
- 'gdsii_cdfeature' uses scaled references instead of boundaries.
- 'gdsii_initialize' sets the stream file version to 7 instead of 3.
- 'gdsii_finalize' does not write version information by default.

2011-Feb-07, Ulf Griesmann
- added better version control and a function which returns toolbox version
  and version of the interpreter that is running it.
- always write version information into a top level structure at the end of
  the layout file.
