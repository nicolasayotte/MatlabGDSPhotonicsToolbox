Boolean Set Operations for the GDS II Octave / MATLAB Toolbox
=============================================================

Beginning with version 86 the GDS II toolbox provides a method
'poly_bool' in the gds_element class that performs Boolean set
operations on GDS boundary elements. This function makes use of the
Clipper library by Angus Johnson (www.angusj.com).The Clipper library
is written in C++ and cannot be compiled with the LCC C compiler that
is included with MATLAB on Windows 32 up to R2011b (?).

The mex interface function must be compiled to make the functionality
available to the GDS II toolbox. Change to either Boolean directory
and type

makemex

at the MATLAB prompt. The same works in Octave, but the shell script

./makemex-octave

can also be run to compile the mex functions.
